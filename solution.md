      "proof": "\n1. **Solution for α ≠ 0.**  \n   For α ≠ 0 the ODE can be rewritten as  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dy}{dU}= \\frac{(1+\\alpha)y+U}{\\alpha U},\n   \\]\n\n   which is linear in \\(y\\).  An integrating factor gives the general solution  \n\n   \\[\n   y+U = C\\,U^{\\,p},\\qquad \n   p:=\\frac{1+\\alpha}{\\alpha}=1+\\frac1\\alpha ,\\quad C\\in\\mathbb R . \\tag{1}\n   \\]\n\n   The trivial solutions correspond to the limits \\(C\\to\\infty\\) (giving \\(U\\equiv0\\)) and \\(C=0\\) (giving \\(U\\equiv -y\\)).  For a non‑trivial solution we must have \\(C\\neq0,\\infty\\).\n\n2. **Special case α = 0.**  \n   When α = 0 the ODE reduces to \\((y+U)U'=0\\).  If \\(y+U\\) is not identically zero, then \\(U'\\equiv0\\) on an open set, and by smoothness and connectedness \\(U\\) is constant; with \\(U(0)=0\\) this forces \\(U\\equiv0\\).  If \\(y+U\\equiv0\\) then \\(U\\equiv -y\\).  Hence the only smooth global solutions with \\(U(0)=0\\) are the two trivial ones; there is no third solution.  In the sequel we assume α ≠ 0.\n\n3. **Necessary condition for a real‑valued global solution.**  \n   Equation (1) defines \\(y\\) as a function of \\(U\\) via  \n\n   \\[\n   y = f(U):= C\\,U^{\\,p}-U .\\tag{2}\n   \\]\n\n   For a smooth global solution \\(U(y)\\) defined on the whole real line, the function \\(f\\) must be real‑valued on all of \\(\\mathbb R\\) and must be a smooth bijection with \\(f(0)=0\\).\n\n   *Real‑valuedness.*  The term \\(U^{p}\\) must be real for every real \\(U\\).  \n   – If \\(p\\) is irrational, then for \\(U<0\\) the expression \\(U^{p}\\) cannot be real (it is a non‑real complex number on every branch of the logarithm).  \n   – If \\(p\\) is rational with an even denominator, the real \\(b\\)-th root does not exist for negative arguments.  \n\n   Consequently, for a solution defined on the whole real line, \\(p\\) must be a rational number with an **odd denominator**.  Write  \n\n   \\[\n   p=\\frac{a}{b},\\qquad a,b\\in\\mathbb Z,\\;b>0,\\;\\gcd(a,b)=1,\\;b\\text{ odd}. \\tag{3}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Positivity of the numerator.**  \n   If \\(a<0\\) (i.e. \\(p<0\\)), then as \\(U\\to0\\) we have \\(|U^{p}|=|U|^{|a|/b}\\to\\infty\\).  \n   Because \\(f(0)=0\\), equation (2) would require \\(C=0\\), which yields the trivial solution \\(U\\equiv -y\\).  Hence for a non‑trivial solution we must have \\(a>0\\).\n\n   Thus \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are positive integers, \\(b\\) odd, and \\(\\gcd(a,b)=1\\).\n\n5. **Reduction to a polynomial problem.**  \n   Introduce the new variable \\(V=U^{1/b}\\) (the real \\(b\\)-th root).  Then \\(U=V^{\\,b}\\) and (2) becomes  \n\n   \\[\n   y = C\\,V^{\\,a}-V^{\\,b}=:P(V). \\tag{4}\n   \\]\n\n   Because \\(a,b\\) are positive integers, \\(P\\) is a polynomial.  The original problem is now equivalent to finding integers \\(a,b\\) (coprime, \\(b\\) odd, \\(a>0\\)) and a constant \\(C\\neq0\\) such that the polynomial \\(P\\) is a smooth bijection \\(\\mathbb R\\to\\mathbb R\\) with \\(P(0)=0\\).\n\n6. **Smoothness at the origin forces the lowest‑degree term to be linear.**  \n   Near \\(V=0\\) the polynomial behaves as its lowest‑degree term.  Assume first that \\(a<b\\); then  \n\n   \\[\n   P(V)=C V^{a}+O(V^{a+1}),\\qquad P'(V)=aC V^{\\,a-1}+O(V^{a}).\n   \\]\n\n   If \\(a>1\\) then \\(P'(0)=0\\).  Differentiating the identity \\(P(V(y))=y\\) gives \\(P'(V(y))\\,V'(y)=1\\); as \\(y\\to0\\) we have \\(V(y)\\to0\\) and consequently \\(V'(y)=1/P'(V(y))\\) would diverge, contradicting the smoothness of \\(V\\) (and hence of \\(U\\)) at the origin.  Therefore we must have \\(a=1\\) whenever \\(a<b\\).\n\n   If \\(a>b\\), the lowest‑degree term is \\(-V^{b}\\).  Interchanging the roles of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the same argument shows that smoothness at the origin forces \\(b=1\\).\n\n   Hence the only possibilities are  \n\n   * either \\(b=1\\) and \\(p=a\\) is an integer,  \n   * or \\(a=1\\) and \\(p=1/b\\) is the reciprocal of an integer.\n\n7. **Case \\(p\\) integer (\\(b=1\\)).**  \n   Here \\(P(V)=C V^{a}-V\\).  Its derivative is \\(P'(V)=aC V^{\\,a-1}-1\\).\n\n   * If \\(a\\) is even, the polynomial has even degree and cannot be monotone on the whole real line; hence no smooth global solution exists.\n   * If \\(a\\) is odd, choose \\(C<0\\).  Then \\(V^{\\,a-1}\\ge0\\) for all real \\(V\\) (because \\(a-1\\) is even), whence  \n\n     \\[\n     P'(V)=aC V^{\\,a-1}-1\\le -1<0 .\n     \\]\n\n     Thus \\(P\\) is strictly decreasing.  Because the leading term \\(C V^{a}\\) has negative coefficient and odd degree, \\(\\lim_{V\\to\\pm\\infty}P(V)=\\mp\\infty\\); consequently \\(P\\) is a bijection \\(\\mathbb R\\to\\mathbb R\\).  For each odd integer \\(a\\ge3\\) we therefore obtain a one‑parameter family of smooth global solutions parametrised by \\(C<0\\).  The value \\(a=1\\) would give the trivial solution \\(U\\equiv -y\\) and is excluded.\n\n   Translating back via \\(p=1+1/\\alpha\\) yields  \n\n   \\[\n   \\alpha=\\frac{1}{p-1}=\\frac{1}{a-1}=\\frac{1}{2k},\\qquad k\\ge1 .\n   \\]\n\n8. **Case \\(p=1/b\\) with \\(b\\) odd (\\(a=1\\)).**  \n   Now \\(P(V)=C V-V^{\\,b}\\).  Its derivative is \\(P'(V)=C-b V^{\\,b-1}\\).\n\n   * If \\(b\\) were even, the term \\(V^{\\,b-1}\\) would change sign and \\(P'\\) could not stay non‑zero for all \\(V\\); no smooth global solution would exist.  By (3) \\(b\\) is odd, so this case does not occur.\n   * Since \\(b\\) is odd, choose \\(C<0\\).  Because \\(b-1\\) is even, \\(V^{\\,b-1}\\ge0\\) for all real \\(V\\), and therefore  \n\n     \\[\n     P'(V)=C-b V^{\\,b-1}\\le C<0 .\n     \\]\n\n     Hence \\(P\\) is strictly decreasing.  The leading term \\(-V^{b}\\) has odd degree, so \\(\\lim_{V\\to+\\infty}P(V)=-\\infty\\) and \\(\\lim_{V\\to-\\infty}P(V)=+\\infty\\); thus \\(P\\) is surjective.  For every odd integer \\(b\\ge3\\) we obtain a one‑parameter family of smooth global solutions with \\(C<0\\).  The value \\(b=1\\) is already covered by the integer case.\n\n   Using \\(p=1+1/\\alpha\\) gives  \n\n   \\[\n   \\alpha=\\frac{1}{p-1}= -\\frac{b}{b-1}= -\\frac{2k+1}{2k},\\qquad k\\ge1 .\n   \\]\n\n9. **Synthesis.**  \n   Collecting the two admissible families, we have  \n\n   \\[\n   \\alpha=\\frac1{2k}\\;(k\\ge1)\\quad\\text{or}\\quad\n   \\alpha=-\\frac{2k+1}{2k}\\;(k\\ge1).\n   \\]\n\n   For each such \\(\\alpha\\) the choice of any constant \\(C<0\\) in (1) yields a smooth global solution \\(U(y)\\) that vanishes at the origin and is neither identically zero nor identically \\(-y\\).  The solution is unique up to the parameter \\(C\\).\n\n10. **No other possibilities.**  \n    If \\(\\alpha\\) does not belong to the above sets, then either  \n    * α = 0 (already treated),  \n    * p is irrational or has an even denominator ⇒ the function \\(U^{p}\\) cannot be real‑valued on the whole real line,  \n    * p is rational with odd denominator but with both numerator and denominator greater than 1 ⇒ the polynomial \\(P\\) in (4) has a lowest‑degree term of degree > 1, which destroys smoothness at the origin,  \n    * p is an even integer ⇒ the polynomial cannot be monotone,  \n    * p is the reciprocal of an even integer ⇒ the denominator would be even, contradicting the requirement that \\(b\\) be odd.  \n\n    In all these situations the only smooth solutions with \\(U(0)=0\\) are the two trivial ones \\(U\\equiv0\\) and \\(U\\equiv -y\\).\n\nThus the set of real numbers α for which the ODE admits a smooth solution different from the two trivial solutions is exactly the one described in the statement. ∎"
