Please help me rewrite these math related contents into standard markdown format for preview. You should obey the following instructions when completing this task:

1. DO NOT modify or alter the original meaning in these contents.
2. You should not use headings in the reformatted contents.
3. Each math formula should be wrapped in dollars like $ $ for inline formula and $$ $$ for multiline one.
4. You should wrap the reformatted contents inside latex environment as \begin{contents}reformatted contents here\end{contents}

Here is the original contents:

\begin{contents}{original_content}\end{contents}
