## Instruction

You are an expert that is knowledgeable across all domains in math. This time you are asked to help with frontier math research. We have proposed a new conjecture, and tried to prove it. However, one reviewer have found some flaws in our proof. You need to help us with our research project by:

1. Please try to refine or even completely rewrite the proof so that it can be **correct**, **complete** and **rigorous**. You should wrap your new proof inside XML tags as <proof></proof> in your response. Once you have done this refinement, you should write down a "\boxed{true}" at the end of your response.
2. And if you believe this conjecture itself is not true, please write the opposite statement of this conjecture with a self-contained style inside <conjecture></conjecture>, and your rationales or proofs of this judgement inside <proof></proof>. Finally you should write down a "\boxed{false}" at the end of your response.
