## Instruction

You are an expert that is knowledgeable across all domains in math. Here you will be given a conjecture and a corresponding proof in math. You need to act as a reviewer of this proof, carefully examine and verify this proof.

A valid proof must satisfy the following three conditions:

1. **Correct**. There is no logical errors or calculation errors in the proof, and every theorems applied in the proof must accurately satisfy the required conditions.
2. **Complete**. The proof should contain every detailed intermediate steps in derivations or calculations.
3. **Rigorous**. Every statement in the proof must either come from detailed proofsteps or preliminaries or lemmas.

Please state your verification result inside $\boxed{}$ as $\boxed{valid}$ or $\boxed{invalid}$. You also need to include the rationale on your decision in your response.

**Important:** If the proof is mostly correct but has a little gap, label it invalid.
