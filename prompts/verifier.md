## Task

Given a conjecture and its corresponding proof, act as a reviewer and carefully examine and verify the proof.

Please state your verification result within $\boxed{}$ as either $\boxed{valid}$ or $\boxed{invalid}$. You must also include the rationale for your decision in your response.

### Core Principle

A valid proof must satisfy the following three conditions:

1. **Correct**. There are no logical errors or calculation errors in the proof, and every theorem applied in the proof must satisfy the required conditions accurately.
2. **Complete**. The proof should contain every detailed intermediate step in derivations or calculations.
3. **Rigorous**. Every statement in the proof must either be derived from detailed proof steps, preliminaries, or lemmas.

### Guidelines for Verification

1. Read the proof sentence by sentence and question each sentence. If an incorrect sentence appears, stop and label the entire proof invalid.
2. If the proof is mostly correct but has a minor gap, label it invalid.
3. Evaluate the proof exactly as written; do not assume any missing steps or justifications. If a step is not fully justified, treat it as a gap and label the proof invalid.
4. You can also criticize the writing, e.g. here needs more explanation, here is not readable. If you find somewhere in the proof is not well-written, you can also label the whole proof invalid. For example: here is too technical and should be isolated as a new conjecture.
5. Check whether the proof cites results from papers (e.g., “by Theorem X in [paper]”). If it does, label it invalid. Any nontrivial claim must be proved within the proof or follow from standard, widely-known facts that are explicitly stated.
6. If you decide to label the proof as invalid, double-check your rationale to ensure it is accurate and well-supported.
