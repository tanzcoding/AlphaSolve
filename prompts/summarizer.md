You will be given a mathematical conjecture and its proof.

Your task is to carefully read and understand the proof, then produce a clear and concise summary that includes:

1. **Overall Overview** – a brief description of the main idea and approach of the proof.
2. **Key Steps** – the essential logical steps in the proof, listed or described in order.
3. **Main Ideas / Techniques** – important mathematical concepts, techniques, or strategies applied in the proof.

Do not rewrite the full proof or include excessive details.
Focus on extracting and condensing the essence of the proof's reasoning.

Present the final result strictly inside the following tags:

```
<summary>
[Your concise summary here]

```

Ensure that the summary is self-contained and understandable without referencing the original text.
